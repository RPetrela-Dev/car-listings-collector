# Car Listings Collector

This project is a web application that scrapes car listing websites to find and display the best deals for specific car models. Built with a FastAPI backend and a modern frontend (to be developed), this app demonstrates scraping, data processing, and visualization techniques in a clean and structured codebase.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
    - Python 3.13+ 
    - Git
    - Node.js (Optional) for frontend development

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/RPetrela-Dev/car-listings-collector.git
cd car-listings-collector/backend


2. Setup the virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # For Windows


3. Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the FastAPI server:

bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


## Usage

1. Access the API:
    - Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000.
    - API documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

2. (Planned) Frontend:
    - Once developed, navigate to the frontend URL to browse car listings.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Backend Setup
    - FastAPI API and basic scraping scripts.

2. **Phase 2**: Advanced Scraping and Task Automation
    - Use Playwright for dynamic web scraping.
    - Schedule scraping tasks using Celery.

3. **Phase 3**: Frontend Development
    - Build a modern UI with Svelte or React.
    - Integrate frontend with the backend API.

4. **Phase 4**: Deployment
    - Package the app with Docker for deployment.
